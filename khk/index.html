              <h4>Board Development</h4>
                <p>
                  Successful nonprofits develop boards whose members have both a strong connection to the mission and to the community through intentional board development.  The inflection points of significant growth, new or renewed vision, challenges to sustainability and leadership transition provide opportunities for strengthening the board.  KHK Consulting can help the board and organization navigate and thrive during these growth points.  Our customized approach will:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Establish a clear and shared understanding of the current situation - the board's strengths and the challenges it faces</li>
                  <li>collaboratively create a vision of the desired future </li>
                  <li>collaboratively create a vision of the desired future </li>
                  <li>foster alignment and commitment to the vision, mission and values</li>
                  <li>develop a plan of action and support implementation, including board recruitment, orientation and ongoing training</li>
                </ul>

              <h4>Leadership Transition</h4>
              The departure of senior leadership presents a challenge and on opportunity to the organization.  KHK Consulting can:
              <ul>
                <li>Proactively assist with succession planning to develop leaders across the organization and prepare for leadership transitions at all levels.</li>
                <li>Establish a Transition Team of staff and board members to gather staff perspectives on the needs of the organization, the strengths of the culture, and the key competencies required of a new chief executive.  This team also provides a vehicle for two-way communication with the search committee of the board, serving to keep staff informed about the process and address any anxieties brought on by the change.</li>
                <li>Create a position description that captures the requirements of the role as well as the organization's mission and vision, in order to attract high potential candidates</li>
                <li>Activate Search - consultant support varies according to the organization's capacity to conduct the search.  Activities may include assisting the Search Committee in setting up the plan, surfacing candidates, screening resumes, phone interviews, in-person interviews and final candidates.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Strategic Planning</h4>

              <p>
                A strategic planning process tailored to the organization's needs will align board, staff and community in a shared vision, clear mission and values, and a commitment to an action plan.  A comprehensive plan will include stakeholder input through focus groups and surveys, a retreat, action teams and a final plan document.  Some organizations choose a shorter process to refine or adjust priorities in an existing long-range plan.  KHK Consulting can design and implement a process customized to your needs and resources.
              </p>
              <p>
